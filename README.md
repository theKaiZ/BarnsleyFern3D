This is more an extended test of the PyOpenGL library. For more information about the Barnsley Fern visit Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern).
I optimized the calculations to show it in 3D and also made a "moving" version of the fern.

For use you need the following Python libs:

 - numba
 - numpy
 - PyOpenGL
 - pygame

If you want to save a video form this you may also require ffmpeg.

The animator should work both on unix and windows systems.

Have fun :D
